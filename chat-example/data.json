I’m perfectly fine with horizontal scrolling, but when that happens, the table breaks out of the layout and the layout just stops at the edge of the original viewable area.\n\nIs there a way to let the divs contain the table so things like background color actually go 100% width?\n\nexample below, and I’m using the sticky footer found here: http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/ 3",
